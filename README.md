## About ## 

This is a component based on Ionic's search-bar component, with the addition of auto-complete ability. This component is super simple and light-weight. Just provide the data, and let the fun begin. This package is compatible with Angular 2+ and Ionic 2+. 

* Try out [the demo](https://tic-tac-toe.jrquick.com) to see it in action!

## Setup ##

* Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

* Run gulp

```bash
gulp
```

## Contributing ##

To contribute, clone the repo. Then, run `npm install` to get the packages needed for the library to work. Running `gulp` will run a series of tasks that builds the files in `/src` into `/dist`. Replace the `/dist` into whatever Ionic application's `node_modules` where you're testing your changes to continuously improve the library.
